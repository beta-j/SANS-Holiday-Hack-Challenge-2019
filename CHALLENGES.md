## Challenge 1 - Mongo Pilfer Challenge ##

### PROCEDURE: ###

When logging in to the terminal, the prompt tells us that the system is running MongoDB.  Trying to run `mongo` fails and returns a hint:

So running `ps ‚Äìedaf` returns:
```
ID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
elf          1     0  0 15:40 pts/0    00:00:00 /bin/bash
mongo        9     1  0 15:40 ?        00:00:02 /usr/bin/mongod --quiet --fork --port 12121 --bind
elf         84     1  0 15:45 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -edaf
```

So I just run mongo again with a `‚Äìport` switch:
```
mongo ‚Äìport 12121
```

Now that we‚Äôre in Mongo we can look around and we get a super helpful hint: **``{"_id" : "You did good! Just run the command between the stars: ** db.loadServerScripts();displaySolution(); **" }``**

Happy to oblige:
```
db.loadServerScripts();displaySolution();
```

## Challenge 2 - Escape Ed ##

### PROCEDURE: ###

Well this was an easy one ‚Äì a quick google search to learn some ‚Äúed‚Äù commands and type `Q` into the terminal ‚Äì that‚Äôs it!

## Challenge 3 - Nyanshell ##

### PROCEDURE: ###

Running `sudo ‚Äìl` we see that we are only allowed to run `chattr` as root.  A quick Google search shows that this tool is used to change file attributes.

Looking at the `/etc/passwd` file we see that user `alabaster_snowball` is booting with the shell `/bin/nsh` which probably explains the Nyan Cat popping up on logon.  Running  `lsattr ‚ÄìaR` in `/bin` shows us that there is only one immutable file in the directory and unsurprisingly it‚Äôs `/nsh`.

`Chattr` comes in handy now ‚Äì we run `sudo chattr ‚Äìi /bin/nsh` to remove the immutable attribute from `nsh`.

We cannot delete `nsh`, but we can edit it.  So the solution is now quite simple:
```
vi /bin/nsh
```

Replace the contents with:
```
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash
```

I can now log in as `alabaster_snowball`...

...and we're in! üòÑ

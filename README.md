Here is my write-up for [The 2019 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge - KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves]([https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2019/)) which I wasn't able to complete.


This was my second time participating in the Holiday Hack Challenge and the first time I submitted a report.

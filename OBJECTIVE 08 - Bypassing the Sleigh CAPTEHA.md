The video makes use of a convenient but of code at [https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo](https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo)
This has a helpful [README.md](https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo?tab=readme-ov-file#image-recognition-using-tensorflow-machine-learning-demo) file with step-by-step installation and usage instructions

Following the instructions in a Linux terminal:
```
> sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
> sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
> sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
> sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow==1.15
> sudo python3 -m pip install tensorflow_hub
```

Still following the instructions we retrain on the downloaded CAPTEHA image set
